------------------------------------------------------------
1. Data Theft and Privacy Invasion
   - Some extensions secretly collect browsing history, search terms, and personal data.
   - This data can be sold to advertisers or attackers without user consent.

2. Phishing and Redirects
   - Malicious extensions can alter webpage content or inject fake login pages.
   - Users may be redirected to phishing sites that steal credentials.

3. Ad Injection and Pop-ups
   - Unwanted ads, pop-ups, and banners are often added by malicious extensions.
   - These can degrade browser performance and trick users into downloading malware.

4. Browser Hijacking
   - Extensions can change the default homepage or search engine without permission.
   - They can force users into visiting affiliate or malicious sites.

5. System Resource Misuse
   - Some extensions run hidden background scripts consuming CPU and memory.
   - A few are even used for cryptocurrency mining without the user’s knowledge.

6. Security Bypass
   - Attackers can use extensions to disable built-in browser security features.
   - Example: Turning off Safe Browsing or blocking security warnings.

7. Unauthorized Remote Control
   - Poorly coded or compromised extensions can be remotely controlled by hackers.
   - This allows attackers to execute arbitrary scripts in the user’s browser.

------------------------------------------------------------
Preventive Measures:

- Only install extensions from verified developers or official stores.
- Regularly review permissions and remove unused extensions.
- Keep browser and security software up to date.
